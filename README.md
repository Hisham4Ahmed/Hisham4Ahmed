## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Hisham Ahmed, an experienced Embedded System Engineer with over 4 years in ECU development and embedded software, particularly within the automotive sector. At Coretech-Innovations, I specialize in developing device drivers, integrating AUTOSAR stacks, and managing diagnostic services using UDS and CAN protocols. My work also includes power management for electrical chargers and implementing V2G and OCPP protocols for Linux-based systems.

I also serve as an Embedded System Trainer at IMT School and ITI, where I teach courses on AVR and ARM architectures, embedded Linux, and automotive systems. My educational background includes a B.Sc. in Communication and Electronics Engineering from Medina Higher Institute.
