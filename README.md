# Hi there 👋, I'm **Hesham Ahmed**

🚀 **Team Leader – Embedded Systems | Automotive • Aerospace • IoT • Robotics**  
🏆 *Engineering Leader building high-reliability systems for real-world and beyond-earth environments*

I design and build **mission-critical embedded systems** that operate where failure is *not an option* — from **automotive ECUs** and **EV charging infrastructure** to **vehicle-mounted and flight-capable aerospace systems**.

With **8+ years of hands-on experience**, I specialize in turning complex hardware into **robust, scalable, and production-ready software**, spanning **bare-metal, RTOS, and Embedded Linux**.

> 💡 *I don’t just write drivers — I architect systems that survive the real world.*

## 🎯 Why CTOs & Tech Leads Stop Here

If you’re evaluating engineers who can **own systems end-to-end**, **lead teams**, and **ship embedded products that don’t fail in production**, this profile is for you.

I operate at the intersection of:
- 🧠 **System architecture & technical decision-making**
- 👥 **Team leadership & execution**
- 🛡️ **Reliability, safety, and long-term maintainability**

I’m trusted with problems where:
- Failure is expensive  
- Debugging happens on real hardware  
- Systems must recover, not just reboot
